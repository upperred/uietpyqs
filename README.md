## How can you contribute?

I am going to explain it with a example,suppose i am a student of CSE-AI branch of batch 2023-27.
So right now, this is my 1st sem of 1st year and i want to add my 1st mid sem exam question paper

### Steps
1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a pdf file less than 2mb containing all subject papers of 1st mid sem exam.
3. ### Now naming of is important-

**Name format= Entry year+Present year+Sem no.+X.pdf**
where
    -- Entry year=22 (for students right now in second year)
                   23 (for students right now in first year)

     -- Present year= 1 (for 1st year student)
                    = 2 (for 2nd year student)
                    = 3 (for 3rd year student)

     --Sem no.= 1 (for 1st sem)
              = 2 (for 2nd sem)
              = 3 (for 3rd sem)
              = 4 (for 4th sem)

      --X= 1 (1st mid sem)
           2 (2nd mid sem)
           3 (quiz)
           4 (end sem)
So for the example taken above the pdf file name would be **23111.pdf**

4. Add that or upload that pdf file to the folder 2023-27pdfs.
5. Now come to the file 2023-27_1st.html and go to the CSE-AI heading under that you can find the line
   `<li>1st mid sem</li>`
   change it to
`<li><a href="2023-27pdfs/23111.pdf">1st mid sem</a></li>`
6. Now verify the changes and send a pull request....
