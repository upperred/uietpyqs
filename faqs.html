		<p><b><u>1. Question</u>:- Why does this website look premitive?</b></p>
		<p><b><u>Answer</u></b>:- The whole foundation of this website is written in just few hours,<br>
		                          which follows KISS principle. I wanted this website to be simple yet<br>
					  functional, because i am not the only contributer. So if code will be <br>
					  simpler then others can contribute very easily.

		</p>

		<p><b><u>2. Question</u>:- Why 'How can you contribute?' section is not simple (means we have to upload file<br> 
			                then change code then send pull request)?</b></p>
		<p><b><u>Answer</u></b>:- Because this is a simple <u>static</u> website which is hosted by Github pages.<br>
		                          And there is no possible way to change or add the content of <u>static</u> website<br>
					  without changing the HTML code.
